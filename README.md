i. Which parts of the assignment were completed:
Program 1, 2 and 3 (Program 3 is definitely not correct but I really tried)

ii. Any bugs that you have encountered
I encountered several times in which I had a completely black output. As for my Program 3, I know that the bug is that the centroids are able to be found in the correct spot, but the lines are not formulated correctly. I'm not sure how to fix it though. 

iii. Complete instructions of how to run our program and iv. The input file (if any) and the output files (if any)
- Run each program one by one starting from p1.cc. This will help with generating images that would be used as an input for the next program. 
- Program 1 can simply be compiled as such: (1) g++ p1.cc image.cc -o p1 (2) ./p1 two_objects.pgm 128 binary_image.pgm
- Program 2 can be run similarly: (1) g++ p2.cc image.cc -o p2 (2) ./p2 binary_image.pgm labeled_image.pgm
- Program 3 can be run the same as Program 2: (1) g++ p3.cc image.cc -o p3 (2) ./p3 labeled_image.pgm output_image.pgm
